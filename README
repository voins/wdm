wdm -- WINGs Display Manager

Wdm combines the functions of a graphical display manager identifying and
authenticating a user on a system with some of the functions of a
session manager in selecting and starting a window manager.  Optionally,
wdm can shutdwn (rebott or halt) the system.

Wdm is a modification of XFree86's xdm package for graphically
handling authentication and system login.  Most of xdm has been
preserved (XFree86 4.2.1.1) with the Login interface based on a WINGs
implementation using Tom Rothamel's "external greet" interface (see
AUTHORS).

See file COPYING for license and warranty information.

See the ChangeLog, NEWS, and TODO files for additional information.

See the INSTALL file for information about configuration adn installation.

***NOTE***********************************************************NOTE****

Please examine (and modify if necessary) the Xsession, Xclients, and
wdm-config files in the wdm config directory (by default: /usr/local/etc/wdm).  Also,
NOTE that the Xsession and Xclients (or ~./Xclients) files MUST be marked
executable.  These files are the shell files which actually create
the user's environment and start the window manager.  In addition, there
can be a ~/.xsession or a ~/.Xclients file for each user
in which case these files are executed (and MUST be marked executable).

Comments, bug reports, and corrections (patches) for other systems
are appreciated.
